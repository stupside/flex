# Flex: A Utility for Flux

Flex is a user interface designed to manage Flux clusters and tenants effectively. It interfaces with GitHub and GitLab APIs to enforce a specific structure on your repository, ensuring consistency and ease of management.

Flex is intended for basic web deployments and supports simple deployment scenarios. This includes exposing specific ports through your DNS by defining domains and subdomains.
